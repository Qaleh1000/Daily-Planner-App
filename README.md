# Daily-Planner-App

Allowing users to enter events in a carefully laid out daily planner

## Description

Creating a Day Planner app that helps organise daily schedules was achieved through the use of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and the Day.js library. The app displays the current day, time blocks, and colour-codes them based on whether they are in the past, present, or future.
Users can input data into each time block and save it using local storage. The app provides a simple yet effective way to record day-to-day tasks.
